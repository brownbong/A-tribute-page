            <h3>A timeline of Alan Turing's life.</h3>
            <div id="points">
            <ul>
                <li><time>1912</time>- Alan Mathison Turing born in Maida Vale, London, to Ethel Sara Turing (nee Stoney) and Julius Mathison Turing.
                </li><li><time>1927</time>- Alan becomes deeply interested in the work of Albert Einstein and is able to develop work done by Einstein based on a questioning of Newton's Laws of Motion.</li>
                <li><time>1929</time>- September - Alan is asked to join the Government Codes and Ciphers School and arrives at Bletchley Park the day after war is declared.</li>
                <li><time>1930-40</time>- With Gordon Welchman, Alan develops the Bombe, a device for decrypting the messages sent by the Germans using their Enigma machine.</li>
                <li><time>1940-42</time>- During 1942, Alan and his colleagues also manage to break the more complicated German Naval Enigma system. This is a tremendous help to the Allies in the Battle of the Atlantic.</li>
                <li><time>1943-45</time>-Alan is asked to work as a top level intelligence link with USA, which he visits to share information on cryptology (code-breaking).</li>
                <li><time>1950</time>- Alan publishes'Computing Machinery and Intelligence' in which he develops the Turing Test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called intelligent. The paper will become very famous.</li>
                <li><time>1952</time>- Alan is arrested for gross indecency and loses his security clearance. He is offered chemical treatment as an alternative to imprisonment. The hormone treatment has a very detrimental effect on him.</li>
                <li><time>1954</time>- Alan's body is found in his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire. The post-mortem finds that his death had been caused by poisoning. A half-eaten apple is found next to him laced with cyanide. His body is cremated at Woking crematorium.</li>
